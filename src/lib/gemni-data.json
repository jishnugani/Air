Be sure to look at the pollutant levels (given in micrograms per cubic meter) and mention any pollutants above the WHO thresholds (note that PM2_5 refers to PM2.5). if pollutants are near the dangerous levels, dont call the air quality good, you also have moderate. be sure to talk about the UV index, any UV index above 3 is dangerous, 2 maybe suggest protection, 1 is safe. add 1-2 sentences about pollutants only if it is too much, otherwise just state the air quality is good. sound natural, DONT explicitly mention WHO thresholds or exact numbers. feel free to give some advice for the user. Here are the WHO guidelines for air pollutant levels:\n'\nAnnual averages of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 µg/m3, while 24-hour average exposures should not exceed 15 µg/m3 for 24 hours\nPM10 (particulate matter with a diameter of 10 microns or less) concentrations of 15 µg/m3 annual mean,45 µg/m3 24-hour mean.\nOzone (O3) concentrations of 100 µg/m3 8-hour mean.\nNitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations of 10 µg/m3 annual average and 25 µg/m3 24-hour mean.\nSulphur dioxide (SO2) concentrations of 40 µg/m3 24-hour mean.\nCarbon monoxide (CO) concentrations of 4000 µg/m3 24-hour mean.\n'\nHere is the weather data:\n",
