## Inspiration
Just like the weather dictates our daily plans, the quality of the air we breathe significantly impacts our health and well-being. Yet, traditional weather apps often gloss over air quality details. Air is born from the desire to empower users, particularly those who can't physically sense weather changes, with comprehensive air quality information.

## What it does
Air goes beyond basic weather data. Enter any location, and Air leverages multiple APIs to provide a detailed picture:

Hyperlocal Weather: Get current and forecasted weather conditions. Aggregated Air Quality: Air integrates data from various air quality and pollutant concentration APIs, giving you the most up-to-date picture of your environment. Actionable Insights: With a clear understanding of air quality, make informed decisions about your day-to-day activities. How we built it

Air utilizes various APIs for weather data, air quality, and geolocation to provide a holistic view. Tech Stack: We built a robust and user-friendly interface using Svelte, TypeScript, and Highcharts.

## Challenges we ran into
API Integration: Merging data from multiple APIs seamlessly proved to be a hurdle, requiring careful data manipulation and normalization. Data Accuracy: Ensuring consistency and accuracy across various data sources was a challenge we tackled through data validation techniques.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Actionable Air Quality Data: Air empowers users with the information they need to make informed health decisions. User-Centric Design: Svelte and Highcharts allowed us to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface.

## What we learned
APIs unlock a world of possibilities, allowing us to combine data from various sources for a richer user experience. The importance of data validation and normalization became paramount in ensuring the app's reliability.

## What's next for Air
Utilizing the potential of AI assistant, Gemini, to further enhance user convenience. Imagine asking Air natural language questions like "Should I go for a run today?" or "Is the air quality safe for outdoor exercise?". By integrating Gemini, Air could analyze weather and air quality data alongside your location and preferences, offering personalized recommendations for your well-being.

We envision Air becoming more than just an app that reports weather. Our next step is to leverage user behavior data. By analyzing how users react to different weather conditions, Air can potentially predict weather patterns based on real-time user actions. This shift from objective data to user reactions presents an exciting opportunity to personalize the user experience even further.
